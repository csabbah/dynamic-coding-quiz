# Code Quiz - March 14th 2022 - Carlos Sabbah

## Purpose / Functionality

UofT challenge #4: Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz. This application will test the user's knowledge about coding with a given timer of 60 seconds. For each incorrect answer, 5 seconds will be deducted. The game ends after ALL questions have been answered OR timer hits 0. The user can save their score (which will be stored in localStorage and an in object) by inputting their initials. The user will be able to view the leaderboard which is sorted by score from highest to lowest. The leaderboard will show the user's initial, score, and the remaining time they had during that session. Finally, the user can also clear ALL the stats both from localStorage and the active object in the 'view highscore' page.
