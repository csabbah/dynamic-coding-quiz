# Code Quiz - March 14th 2022 - Carlos Sabbah

## Purpose / Functionality

UofT challenge #4: Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz. This application will test the user's knowledge about coding. The quiz will be timed starting at 60 seconds and will decrement by 5 for each incorrect question answered. The user will have the ability to save their score (to localStorage and an active object) by inputting their initials and they will be presented with the leaderboard (which is sorted by score from highest to lowest). For each session, the user's score on the leaderboard will be uniquely styled to indicate the 'current score'. The leaderboard will display the user's submitted initial, their score, and the remaining time they had during that session. If the user goes back to the home page and clicks on 'view highscore', they will have the ability to clear the stats (both from localStorage and the active object).
